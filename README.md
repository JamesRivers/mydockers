# Dockers ...
This repo is dedicated to the containers I have used and reviewed in the past. 
In each folder you should find details on each container. 
We have in no particular order:
- guacamole - access tool used for rdp, vnc, ssh love this tool
- heimdall - dashboard for jumping to differing systems - it's ok, not great but serves a purpose.
- uptime kuma - poor mans prometheus/grafana, is that fair? Not really an easy to set up application for monitoring the applications, servers, services in your world. 
- lazy docker or lzd, nice easy to use docker review tool
- nextcloud 
- destreamer
- wiki.js
- postgres review
- postgres diagram
